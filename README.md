Implementation of "Semi-Supervised Deep Adversarial Learning for Brain-Computer Interface"

  
* Programming Language : Python3
* Contact : W.-J. Ko (wjko@korea.ac.kr)
* Function : We provide a deep generative and discriminative adversarial learning framework for brain computer interface. This framework captures the distribution of real EEG and generates artificial EEG thereby helping the classification improvement of feature extractor and classifier.
